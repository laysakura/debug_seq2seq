# debug seq2seq
Make [seq2seq for keras](https://github.com/farizrahman4u/seq2seq) work.

The code includes:

* small dataset of movie scripts to train your models on
* preprocessor function to properly tokenize the data
* word2vec helpers to make use of gensim word2vec lib for extra flexibility
* train and predict function to harness the power of seq2seq
 

**Warning**

* The code has bugs, undoubtedly. Feel free to fix them and pull-request.

**Setup&Run**

    git clone https://github.com/nicolas-ivanov/debug_seq2seq
    cd debug_seq2seq
    bash bin/setup.sh
    pip install --upgrade --no-deps .
    python bin/train.py
or

    python bin/test.py
    
If you have missing packages, install it by pip. For example,

    pip install --upgrade --no-deps gensim
